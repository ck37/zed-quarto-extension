### implement-inline-attributes

**Status**: âœ… Completed and Archived (2025-10-17)
**Location**: `openspec/changes/archive/implement-inline-attributes`
**Outcome**: Successfully implemented after initial pause

The inline attributes feature was successfully implemented despite initial LR(1) parser challenges. The implementation uses the link-based approach from the official quarto-markdown grammar and includes:
- 15 passing tests for inline attributes
- Support for `[text]{#id}`, `[text]{.class}`, and `[text]{key="value"}` syntax
- WASM parser verification confirming correct parsing

See archived spec for full implementation details.
