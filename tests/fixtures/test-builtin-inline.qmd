# Testing Bold and Italic with Built-in markdown-inline

This document tests whether injecting Zed's built-in `markdown-inline` grammar works for emphasis.

## Basic Emphasis

This is **bold text** using double asterisks.

This is __bold text__ using double underscores.

This is *italic text* using single asterisk.

This is _italic text_ using single underscore.

This is ***bold and italic*** using triple asterisks.

## Mixed Content

Here's a sentence with **bold**, *italic*, and ***bold italic*** text all together.

Links should work: [link text](https://example.com)

Inline code should work: `code here`

## Pandoc Extensions

These might NOT work with standard markdown-inline:

Strikethrough: ~~deleted text~~

Subscript: H~2~O

Superscript: E=mc^2^

## Expected Results

If the built-in injection works:
- ✅ Bold with ** and __ should highlight
- ✅ Italic with * and _ should highlight
- ✅ Links should highlight
- ✅ Inline code should highlight
- ❌ Pandoc-specific features (strikethrough, sub/super) might not work

If it fails:
- ❌ Bold and italic won't highlight (same as before)
