All major components are now ordered and on their way. The Keychron Q8 fully assembled keyboard ($160) is shipping from Keychron and should arrive in 4-6 business days. The Canjoy wrist pads ($10), silicone bumpers ($9), Official Keychron carrying case ($25-30), and Keybridg aluminum platform ($30) are all ordered and arriving soon. The Keybridg should arrive first, likely on Thursday. You've also ordered neodymium magnets ($25) which you may or may not need depending on how well the wrist pads grip your MacBook's surface.
