Quarto brings literate programming to Zed with first-class syntax highlighting for `.qmd` files. This extension uses `tree-sitter-quarto` for comprehensive Quarto-aware syntax highlighting.

> **Note**: This extension addresses [zed-industries/zed#12406](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/issues/12406).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository locally.
2. In Zed, open the command palette and run `zed: install dev extension`, then select this repository directory.

Zed will automatically compile the extension and its grammars.

## Features

### Syntax Highlighting

Powered by [`tree-sitter-quarto`](https://github.com/ck37/tree-sitter-quarto):

- **Quarto-specific**: executable code cells, chunk options (`#| key: value`), inline code cells, cross-references
- **Pandoc extensions**: fenced divs, attribute lists, heading attributes (`## Title {.unnumbered}`), citations, shortcodes, strikethrough (`~~text~~`), subscript (`H~2~O`), superscript (`x^2^`), highlight (`==text==`), underline (`[text]{.underline}`)
- **Core Markdown**: headings, bold (`**text**`), italic (`*text*`), links (`[text](url)`), inline code (`` `code` ``), code blocks, lists, YAML front matter (full spec support via language injection)
- **Math support**: inline (`$...$`) and display (`$$...$$`) with LaTeX syntax
- **Tables**: pipe tables with alignment markers
- **Embedded language injections**: Python, R, Julia, SQL, JavaScript, TypeScript, Bash code chunks

### Preview Command

Preview your Quarto documents in your default browser:

1. Open a `.qmd` file in Zed
2. Open the Assistant panel (Cmd+? or Ctrl+?)
3. Type `/quarto-preview` and press Enter
4. Your document will render and open in your browser with live reload

**Requirements:**
- [Quarto CLI](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) must be installed and available in your PATH
- The document must be saved to disk before previewing

**Note**: The preview opens in your browser (not in-editor) because Zed's extension API doesn't currently support custom preview panes. This matches how `quarto preview` normally works. For more details, see [`openspec/changes/add-quarto-preview/design.md`](openspec/changes/add-quarto-preview/design.md).

> **Note**: This extension provides syntax highlighting and preview only. For language server features (completions, hover, diagnostics), see [`docs/lsp-status.md`](docs/lsp-status.md) for the current state and options.

## Known Limitations

### Highlighting Limitations

Some Pandoc extensions parse correctly but don't highlight in Zed due to theme limitations: strikethrough (`@text.strike`), highlight/mark (`@text.highlight`), subscript (`@text.subscript`), and superscript (`@text.super`). These will highlight if/when Zed adds theme support. See [`docs/pandoc-extensions-scope-issue.md`](docs/pandoc-extensions-scope-issue.md) for details.

### Other Limitations

- **Preview/render workflows**: Out of scope for this extensionâ€”use the Quarto CLI or VSCode extension for visual editing and preview.
- **Grammar completeness**: tree-sitter-quarto is in active development (203/203 tests passing). Some edge cases in Quarto/Pandoc syntax may not be fully supported yet. See the [grammar repository](https://github.com/ck37/tree-sitter-quarto) for current status.
